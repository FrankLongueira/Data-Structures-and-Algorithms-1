# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-1
Course: DSA 1 (ECE-164)

This repository contains project work from a DSA 1 course taken at The Cooper Union. The project work includes C++ programs involving stacks, queues, linked lists, vectors, sorting, pointers, &amp; hash tables.



"Miscellaneous C++ Programs" contains C++ programs written to practice coding sorting algorithms, recursion, using lists & vectors, hashing, binary search, and a cool mathematical trick that guesses your number!



"Programming Assignment #1 - Implementing Stack/Queue Data Structures & Manipulation Program" contains C++ files for a project that implements stack & queue data structures and reads in an input text file of manipulation commands. Then an output text file is written that summarizes the commands processed. The files in this folder are:

"Main.cpp" - This file is to be compiled and its executable file to be ran.

"ParsingProcessing.h" - This header file includes parsing & processing function implementations that were created for the assignment.

"Program Assignment #1.docx" This is the instructions document for the assignment.

"Queue.h" - The is the derived class implementation of a queue data structure using polymorphism. It is derived from the abstract base               class found in "Simplelist.h"

"Stack.h" - The is the derived class implementation of a stacks data structure using polymorphism. It is derived from the abstract base              class found in "Simplelist.h"

"SimpleList.h" - This is an abstract base class that implements simple singly linked list functionality & has two pure virtual functions
                for the stack/queue derived classes.



"Programming Assignment #2 - Sorting" contains C++ & text files for a project that seeked to sort various lists of numbers in the      shortest possible time. The files in this folder are:


"Main.cpp" - This file is to be compiled and its executable to be ran. It reads in an input file of numbers, applies an appropriate sorting algorithm to sort the numbers, and then writes the final sorted list of numbers to an output text file. Insertion sort, counting sort, and recursive MSD radix sort were implemented in this program.

"Programming Assignment #2 - Instructions" - This document contains the explicit instructions that were assigned for this project.

"input.txt" & "output.txt" - These text files represent the input & output lists of about 100,000 40-digit numbers after using recursive MSD radix sort. The input list was sorted using this algorithm in 0.07 seconds & the output list contains the final sorted list.

"input1.txt" & "output1.txt" - These thext files represent the input & output lists of about 1,000,000 6-digit numbers after using counting sort. The input list was sorted using this algorithm in 0.2 seconds & the output list contains the final sorted list.
